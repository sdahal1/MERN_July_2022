  Time Complexity
    - Best case: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
    - Average case: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
    - Worst case: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
  Space: O(n) linear
  steps:
    1. create a merge function to merge two already sorted arrays into a single
        sorted array.
      - you do NOT need to work in place, ok to use a new array
    2. create mergeSort function to sort the provided array
      - split the array in half and recursively merge the halves using the
          previously created merge function.
      - splitting of arrays stops when array can no longer be split.
      - an array of 1 item is by definition sorted, so two arrays of 1 item
          can therefore be merged into a sorted array.
