//Imagine you have to be home to sign off on an important package that will be delivered at an approximate time
//however you have several other tasks to do (make coffee, text family, do homework)


//option A: don't do anything at all until the package gets there. Then i can make coffe, text family, and do homework.
//option B: while waiting for the package, do as many tasks as i can, and then when the doorbell rings with the package, sign off on package and go back to what I was doing



//API (Application Programming Interface) calls are an example of this type of workflow. A Promise is when you have some code that is running and while you're waiting for that code to finish running, you can tell the computer to do some other lines of code instead of waiting for a certain line of code to finish executing.

//API is a source for some external data that you can use in your application
